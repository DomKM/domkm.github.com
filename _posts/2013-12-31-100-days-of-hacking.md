I attended the second cohort of [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) in the Summer of 2012.  This was before it was on national news, before it was proven as a business or training program, and before there were nearly as many code camps as there were companies hiring junior developers.  While Dev Bootcamp taught me many things (both technical and non-technical) and has influenced my life in profoundly positive ways, perhaps the most important skill I developed there was learning how to learn.  Not how to pass tests, not how to write bullshit papers, not any of the "skills" that traditional education so thoroughly ingrained in me.  It forced me to develop the skills to learn practical material quickly and figure out what I need to learn next.

During Dev Bootcamp, I spent nearly 100 hours per week actively learning.  Since Dev Bootcamp, I have been working as a (mostly) independent software developer.  Consulting full-time affords me little time to learn unless the subject directly and immediately benefits my clients.  I decided to invest the first 100 days of 2014 in myself.[^100-full-days]  No clients, no invoices, and no external deadlines; just the pursuit of knowledge.

Initially, I intended to pursue a wide variety of topics, including computer science fundamentals (like algorithms, networks, and data structures), machine learning, SQL (with an emphasis on PostgreSQL), UNIX, Java and JVM, and Git internals.  While I am ambitious and want to push myself, it was clear that I would be unable to delve into that many topics given my time constraints, so I narrowed my subjects down significantly.  I want to be pragmatic and focus on subjects which will better enable me to create web applications.  I have a laundry list of books and [MOOC](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)s that I want to read and do, but I will defer them.

I broke the curriculum into two phases.  The first being a refresh and exploration of technologies that I use frequently but do not understand as well as I wish to (CSS, HTML, and JavaScript) and the second being an in-depth exploration of Lisp (with an emphasis on Clojure).  I will update this blog frequently and update [this repo](https://github.com/DomKM/100-days-of-hacking) daily.  Starting tomorrow: 100 days of hacking.

[^100-full-days]: I will only count days in which I spend most of the time learning, so my 100 days of hacking will probably span over more than 100 days.
